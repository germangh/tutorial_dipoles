====== Part I: A realistic head model ======

[[tutorial:tutorial_dipoles|Back to the tutorial homepage]]

In this tutorial we  use a realistic electromagnetic model to map 
intracerebral current sources (modeled as dipoles) to a set of EEG sensors.
Our model is based on a real MRI scan from an unknown subject identified 
by the code ''0003''. Below are the main steps that we need to take in order 
to build our head model. The first three steps have been already performed
 for you, but you will need to carry out the other four steps to 
successfully a model that we can play around with. 

==== Step 1: Tissue segmentation ====

Different brain tissues have different characteristic conductivities. A 
realistic head model needs to take this fact into account and, therefore, 
tissue types need to be segmented. Typically, only scalp, skull and 
cerebral tissues need to be identified in order to build a reasonably 
accurate electromagnetic model. However, you can complicate your model 
by segmenting also white and gray matter and, if you really like making 
your life difficult, by taking into consideration the fact that tissue
 conductivity (especially within white matter) is [[wp>anisotropy|anisotropic]].

In the old times, brain tissues had to be manually or semi-automatically 
segmented. This was not only time consuming but also highly subjective. 
Fortunately, the standardization of MRI scanning technology has
allowed the development of extremely accurate fully-automated tissue 
segmentation packages. There are multiple freely available alternatives but,
arguably, the most robust and widely tested software package is 
{{http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/|Freesurfer}}, developed at the 
{{http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/martinos/|Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging}}.  


==== Step 2: Surface reconstruction ====

Once different tissues  have been identified, we need to build closed 
triangulated surfaces between all relevant tissue types. In our model we 
have three such surfaces: the _outer skin_ surface (on which the 
EEG sensors rest), the //outer skull// surface, and the //inner skull// surface
(within which the //EEG sources// may be located). These surfaces can be 
automatically generated using a variety of software packages. In this 
tutorial we used the //watershed// algorithm included in the 
{{http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/martinos/userInfo/data/MNE_register/|MNE software}}, 
which is also maintained by the {{http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/martinos/|Athinoula A. Martinos Center}}. 

The resulting surfaces are available in ''.tri'' data format in folder 
''datasim/db/0003'':

	0003-inner_skull-5120.tri
	0003-inner_skull-dense.tri
	...
	0003-outer_skin-5120.tri
	0003-outer_skin-dense.tri
    

There are two versions of each surface. The ''dense'' surfaces are just
more densely tessellated versions of the ''5120'' surfaces, which consist of
(only) 5120 vertices. 
    

==== Step 3: Sensor co-localization ====

The purpose of having a densely tesselated outer skull surface is that 
it allows for more accurate co-registration of the EEG sensor locations. That 
is, it makes it easier to match each EEG sensor with a surface vertex.
For this tutorial we use a state-of-the-art sensor net with 256 sensors by
 {{http://www.egi.com|EGI}}. The standard sensor locations provided by EGI were co-registered
 with surface ''0003-outer_skull-dense.tri'' using {{http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/|Fieldtrip}}, and
 are available in file ''0003-sensors.hpts''. The latter is just a text file that
 you can inspect with a text editor, if you want.

 
==== Step 4: Loading and inspecting the anatomical model ====

You can load the surface information into MATLAB using the command:

	myHead = head.mri('SubjectPath', 'db/0003')
  
assuming of course that you are in the ''tutorial_dipoles'' folder that you
 created when you unzipped the tutorial files. The command above will
 create an //object// of class ''head.mri''. An object is just a convenient
 representation for a bunch of _data_ and operations (or _methods_) that
 can be performed on that data. Using 
 {{http://www.mathworks.nl/company/newsletters/articles/introduction-to-object-oriented-programming-in-matlab.html|objects with MATLAB}}
 is still relatively unusual among MATLAB developers. Despite the
 limitations of MATLAB's OOP ([[wp>Object-oriented_programming|Object Oriented Programming]]) 
 implementation, I personally like the objected oriented programming
 paradigm and that's the only reason why I use it in this tutorial.

You can now easily plot the model surfaces with the command:

	figure; 
	plot(myHead);

Just for fun, see ''help head.mri.plot'' and try to make a figure that displays
only the inner skull surface and the locations of the sensors. If you want, 
you can save your figures in various graphics formats using MATLAB 
built-in command ''print''. For instance, the command:

	print -dpng myfigure.png
  
will save the current figure in [[wp>portable_network_graphics|portable network graphics]] format in a
file called ''myfigure.png''.

If you zoom in the head model that we generated above, you will see that the EEG
sensors (displayed as red dots) do not fall exactly on vertices of the outer
skin surface. See the figure on the right below. 

{{tutorial:tutorial_dipoles:head_model.png?350x350}}

The anatomical triangulated surfaces of our head model. The red dots identify
the locations of the EEG sensors. Note that the EEG sensors (red dots) do not
fall on surface vertices.

However, recall that we said that EEG sensors need to be co-registered
with vertices of the outer skin surface. The reason for the discrepancy is that
 we performed the co-registration using the ''dense'' version of the outer 
skin surface but our head model is actually based on a lower-resolution 
triangulated surface (the ''0003-outer_skull-5120.tri'' surface). Indeed, you 
can see that the sensors do fall on vertices of the ''dense'' surface:

	figure;
	h = plot(myHead, 'Surface', 'OuterSkinDense');
	set(h(1),'facealpha',1,'edgealpha',1);

The '''facealpha''' and '''edgealpha''' are just properties of the surface plot 
that we can use to manipulate the transparency of the triangles (the //faces//) and of the edges.
The densely tessellated outer skin surface is shown below. Note how the sensor locations fall
 exactly on surface vertices.

{{tutorial:tutorial_dipoles:head_model_dense_zoomed.png?350x350}}

You can force the sensors to really fall on vertices of the low resolution
outer skin surface with the command:

	myHead = sensors_to_outer_skin(myHead)


==== Step 5: Intracerebral source grid ====

In order to build an electromagnetic model we need to specify the 
spatial locations where EEG sources may be located. This is typically done by
uniformly sampling the inner skull volume using a regular 3D grid:

	myHead = make_source_grid(myHead, 0.5)
	
where the second input argument is a scalar in the range [0 1] that determines
the density of the generated grid. The higher the density, the higher the number
of elements in the source grid. Play a bit with the density value to see how
 it works. However, this tutorial has been tested only with a grid 
 density of 0.5. Using a higher or lower value might have unexpected results, 
 like abnormally inaccurate inverse solutions, and is not recommended. 
 The 3D grid of candidate EEG source locations is shown below. On the second 
 image, only the grid locations within the inner skull surface are displayed. 
 The latter will be the allowed locations for the EEG sources that we will 
 simulate later.
 
{{tutorial:tutorial_dipoles:source_grid_1.png?350x350}}
{{tutorial:tutorial_dipoles:source_grid_2.png?350x350}}
	
What do you think are the benefits of having a denser source grid? And the
disadvantages?
	

==== Step 6: BEM computation ====

The steps above have fully described the anatomical aspects of our head model.
It is now time to compute the electromagnetic model. That is, to describe the
mapping that relates activity at the source grid locations to activity at the
scalp sensor locations. This mapping can be computed using a 
[[wp>boundary_element_method|Boundary Element Method (BEM)]].

Again, there are multiple freely available software packages implementing the
BEM. {{http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/|EEGLAB}}, 
{{{{http://fieldtrip.fcdonders.nl/|Fieldtrip}}, and the 
{{http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/martinos/userInfo/data/MNE_register/|MNE software}}
 are just three examples. Moreover, each of these software
packages include several algorithms for computing the BEM coefficients. In this
tutorial we use the default algorithm 
{{http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/10.19859|(Oostendorp and Oosterom, 1989)}}
 of the Fieltrip toolbox. To compute the BEM model, just run the command:

	myHead = make_bem(myHead);


The step above might take few minutes to compute.
As you may have guessed already, the computation of the BEM model will take
longer, the denser the triangulated boundaries of the model. This is precisely
the reason why we did not use the ''dense'' surfaces to build our model, but
 decided to use those only for sensor co-registration purposes. An even more
important problem of using too dense surfaces is that it can lead to numerical
innaccuracies due to the fact that the model may become [[wp>condition_number|ill-conditioned]].


==== Step 7: Leadfield generation ====

The actual mapping from source grid locations to EEG sensors (also known as
the //leadfield matrix//) is computed, based on the BEM model, with the
following command:

	 myHead = make_leadfield(myHead);

This step may also take a couple of minutes to compute. It will take longer
the higher the number of sensors and the higher the number of source grid
locations. 

The result of this step is a 257x3xN matrix, where N is the number of 
source grid locations. This matrix is stored in the ''LeadField'' property
of our ''myHead'' object:

	myHead.LeadField	% The leadfield matrix

The meaning of the leadfield matrix is straightforward. If you had a 
dipole ''m=[m_x, m_y, m_z]'' at the ''i''th grid location (whose coordinates
are in ''myHead.SourceSpace.pnt(i,:)''), then the EEG measured at the ''j''th
sensor would be:

	squeeze(myHead.LeadField(j, :, i))*m'

There is an important point that you should realize here. The scalp
potentials generated by a source dipole do not depend only 
on the strength of the source (the length of the dipole) but they do 
also __strongly depend on its orientation__. As you will see below, dipoles
that are close to the scalp and are tangentially or radially oriented 
with respect to the scalp surface generate very 
characteristic distributions of potentials across the scalp.

__NOTE:__ Computing the leadfield matrix requires solving 
{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations|Maxwell equations}}, 
under the boundary conditions imposed by the head model. These are 
complicated differential equations and some of you may wonder how can 
their solution be as simple as a linear and instantaneous mapping. 
The answer is that the exact solution to Maxwell equations is far from 
being that simple. However, in EEG and MEG applications we take advantage of the
fact that the signals measured rarely exceed frequencies above 1 KHz. 
At such low frequencies, we can safely use the so-called quasi-static
approximation of Maxwell equations, which indeed leads to a solution
that is just a linear and instantaneous mapping. For those interested in 
bioelectromagnetism I recommend the book by 
{{http://www.bem.fi/book/|(Malmivuo and Plonsey, 1995)}}.


==== What now? ====
 
Now you are ready to go to [[tutorial:tutorial_dipoles:eeg_sources|Part II]]
 of this tutorial where we will use
the head model that we just prepared to simulate EEG sources and to study
the patterns of scalp potentials that such sources generate.
